                    <p>Say hello to a 7-month-old Beabull -- a Beagle and 
                        Bulldog mix. He is a VERY sweet boy who was surrendered 
                        by his owners who didn't have the time to care for him. 
                        He has recently been fully vetter and neutered. Twix gets 
                        along with kids, dogs, people; cats are unknown but he's 
                        such a mush he probably be fine with them.
